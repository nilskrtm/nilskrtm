## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nils. Welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜„

In my position as a working student, I mainly deal with backend work with <b>Java</b> in the web area. This is also the language I started with programming in the first place over 5 years ago.
During my free time I like to work with new technology to expand my knowledge. Lately I'm mainly working on a small hobby project for creating and analyzing surveys. 
Here I have especially found fun in working with <b>Typescript</b> and <b>React</b>. The project consists of the backend, a website to manage the surveys and an app to vote on them. See yourself:

- [Survey Backend](https://github.com/nilskrtm/survey-test-api)
- [Survey Web](https://github.com/nilskrtm/survey-test-web)
- [Survey App](https://github.com/nilskrtm/SurveyTestApp)

> Since I work on the repositories alone and currently use them mainly as a way to collaborate on my own between my laptop and desktop, the Git history is not necessarily meaningful. Also, the project is still a _WIP_ and there are still some improvements I want to make but haven't had the time yet.
